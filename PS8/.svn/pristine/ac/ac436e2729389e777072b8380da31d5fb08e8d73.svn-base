We decided to do most of our work in a BoggleGame class that has two players.
The BoggleServer class creates a BoggleGame once two players have sent their name.
The BoggleGame class then takes care of timing, scoring, and all other aspects of the game.

A lot of our testing was done using a model/view setup that is very similar to the chat server 
example from lab. Unit tests were made once most functionality was already working.

We spent about 2 hours creating a design and uderstanding the specs, 5 hours coding, 3 hours 
testing, and 5 hours debugging.
