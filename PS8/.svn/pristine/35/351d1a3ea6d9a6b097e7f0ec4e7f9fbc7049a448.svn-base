We decided to do most of our work in a "boggle game"  that had two players

Alot of our testing was done using the server client example from lab and unit test were basic because
we felt this did a good job of testing our server

We spent 2 hours creating a design and uderstading the specs 5 hours coding and 5 hours debugging and 3 hour testing
